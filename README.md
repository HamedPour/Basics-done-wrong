Hello ALL,


This is, as the name of the repo suggests, my personal page.

I've taken the time to make this using PostCSS and opted to not use Bootstrap
for the simple fact that I had more customizable freedom.

I am still working on the Javascript and am planning on added more functionality to it.

I hope you like it.

Also, If you ever read this I would love your feedback on the design and code.
I know it’s a hassle but if you could please give me some feedback I would be very grateful.

Thank you all
Hamed

PS:
Special thanks to Mart Roosmaa for being a brilliant Estonian programmer and friend. Would have never gotten into programming without his “C++ programming in 30 days”.
